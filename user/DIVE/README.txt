DIVE
by Paul Cho, 2018

With the surface quickly freezing over, you take to the water to find shelter. Descend quickly but methodically to see if you can make it all the way to 10,000 feet below!

The game itself has basic controls and gameplay notes on the title screen. This file is for anybody who wants a clearer explanation of exactly how things work, but I would encourage you to give a few attempts before reading further, as most things in the game should become self-explanatory after a few tries.

CONTROLS:

+ LDR Arrows or ASD to move left, right, or down.
+ Up Arrow or W to skip turn / rest**
+ Left Mouse Button or Space to toggle Jets (once the item is obtained)
+ Control-F to toggle fullscreen.
+ R to restart game if your character has died.
+ Right Mouse Button to purchase items from a Trader.

GAMEPLAY:

+ You have 3 things to keep track of as you move on - Air, Money, and Depth. Air is spent when you make any moves besides skipping/resting, and running out will cause your health to start depleting. Money is obtained by beating enemies, and is used to make purchases with the Trader. Depth is how deep you are into the map, and determines the difficulty level. 

+ Your goal is to make it to 10,000 feet. Hazards will become more frequent as you descend, and the pressure will increase, causing you to consume your air supply more quickly. The current "air cost" of each move is indicated by the red square next to your current air supply.

+ All moves are performed before any damage is calculated. Because of this, enemies cannot attack you unless you deliberately move into the space next to them. Additionally, you can "swap" places with a magma hazard if it's coming towards you and is in the adjacent spot.

+ Moving to the side will cause you to move at a diagonal if there is no support beneath you. The only times that moving side to side will not also move you down are
--- When the block next to you is open, but the block beneath it is not
--- When you have attack a block in the previous turn
--- When you have just used the jet
Keep this in mind when there are hazards beneath you.

+ **Resting will restore a 1 air to your tank. Resting occurs when you press Up/W on top of a stone block. Pressing Up/W on top of a flame block or above nothing will simply skip a turn without replenishing any air.

OTHER NOTES:

+ This is supposed to be a pretty short game. Halfway through development of this game, I started to get some more ambitious ideas to implement, but ultimately decided to cut them out. This game was made in only a few days, and is meant to be short and simple. I may update the game in the future with some of the bigger ideas, but for now, the game should be considered finished. Otherwise, updates will be for things like bug fixes or adjustments.

+ Thanks for playing!

+ I wrote this README in Notepad, so there's definitely a chance that it's riddled with typos. Oops!
