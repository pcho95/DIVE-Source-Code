WORK IN PROGRESS, DEFINITELY NOT THE FINISHED PRODUCT

CONTROLS:
- UP to skip/rest
- LEFT, RIGHT to move sideways/diagonally
- DOWN to move down
- ESC to quit (press twice)

GAMEPLAY:
- Keep moving to avoid the slowly approaching ice from above
- Press UP while on top of a solid block to restore AIR
--> UP will not restore when a block isn't under the player, but does skip a turn
- You will lose health when running out of air or being within the same space as an ice block
- See how far you can get before your character dies!

NOTES:
** Traders don't currently do anything
** Enemies don't currently do anything


thanks for playing!
